          <strong>Why is mobile website design so important? </strong> Graph icon of Mobile usersSince 2018, 52% of global online traffic came from mobile devices and has overtaken desktop internet users. In fact, it’s been ahead since 2015 (35.1%). This means that more and more people are picking up their mobile phones and quickly searching to get the answers they need. Now imagine you came across a website that was only built for desktop users, all that pinching and zooming to navigate a site just to find the right information you need? Annoying right? So, as any web user does, you jump from the page that is a pain to navigate and click on the next one with the same search credentials. For your company you want to keep the user on your site and make it as easy as possible to find what they are looking for.

          Way back in 2015 Google announced an update that would change the way websites rank forever. This was the algorithm change that favoured mobile friendly websites .We have  seen a drop in certain sites rankings because owners have neglected to put this change in to effect and Google have penalised them. On the other hand, Google rewarded mobile friendly websites with a boost in rankings. A few years later and mobile design is more important than ever due to the rise in mobile / tablet sales and more and more people opting to grab their tablets rather than their laptops.
